Debugging is twice as hard as writing code in the first place. Therefore,
if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition,
not smart enough to debug it.
        Brian Kernighan

Contrary to popular belief, Unix is user friendly.
It just happens to be selective about who it makes friends with.
        Dave Parnas

Telling a programmer there's already a library to do X is like
telling a songwriter there's already a song about love.

If debugging is the process of removing software bugs,
then programming must be the process of putting them in.
        Edsger Dijkstra

The object-oriented version of spaghetti code is, of course,
'lasagna code'. Too many layers.
        Roberto Waltman

Being a good programmer is 3% talent 97% not being distracted by the internet.

Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
        Brian Kernigham

A primary cause of complexity is that software vendors uncritically
adopt almost any feature that users want.
        Niklaus Wirth

Minimize complexity.
The simpler the product, the more likely you are to actually ship it,
and the more likely you are to fix problems quickly.
        Slava Akhmechet

The costs of complexity, rough as they are during development,
bite hardest after deployment.
        Eric Steven Raymond

So much complexity in software comes from trying to make one thing do two things.
        Ryan Singer

No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece
of perfect software. It's unlikely that you'll be the first.
        Andy Hunt

Everybody wants to write reusable code.
Nobody wants to reuse anyone else's code.

Good code is its own best documentation.
        Steve McConnell

If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.
        Alan Perlis

One of the best programming skills you can have is knowing
when to walk away for awhile.
        Oscar Godson

Make it correct, make it clear, make it concise, make it fast. In that order.
        Wes Dyer

Deleted code is debugged code.
        Jeff Sickel

If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs,
then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.
        Gerald Weinberg

One accurate measurement is worth a thousand expert opinions.
        Grace Hopper

The key to performance is elegance, not batalions of special cases.
        Jon Bentley and Doug McIlroy

It’s not at all important to get it right the first time.
It’s vitally important to get it right the last time.
        The Pragmatic Programmer

One of the best programming skills you can have
is knowing when to walk away for a while.
        Oscar Godson

With so much information now online, a strong work ethic and growth
mindset, even more than knowledge, predicts your future success.
        Andrew Ng

The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express yourself in code.
        Uncle Bob Martin

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
        Martin Fowler

Inside every well-written large program is a well-written small program.
        C.A.R Hoare

Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking.
        Rich Hickey

The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time.
The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.
        John Johnson

The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything.
The weakness is that you will.
        Reg Braithwaite

I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.

Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding.
        Burt Rutan

Testing can show the presence of errors, but not their absence.
        E. W. Dijkstra

Would you rather Test-First or Debug-Later?
        Robert Marti

Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring
aircraft building progress by weight.
        Bill Gates

Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.
